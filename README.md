# Color Identification and Display Tool with OpenCV and CSV Data
 This program demonstrates a practical application of image processing, data handling, and user interaction for color identification and display.



Libraries Used:

OpenCV (cv2): For image processing tasks (reading, displaying, drawing on images)
pandas (pd): For reading and manipulating data from the CSV file
numpy (np): (Probably not explicitly used in this code, but often used with OpenCV for numerical computations)
